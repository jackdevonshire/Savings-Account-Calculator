# Savings-Account-Calculator
A basic C# application for calculating the potential returns of various savings accounts.

## Important Note - 25/07/2024
Looking back over the code, there are probably tons of errors in this. I will leave the repo up for now as an archive, but I would ultimately really like to revisit this at some point as learning about all of the finance and rates was quite interesting.

## Why Make This?
After starting my graduate job, I realised I needed a plan for effectively saving my money. A lot of research and google sheets formulas later,
I figured out the perfect allocation of my funds on a monthly basis, to maximise my payoff over various accounts. As with all savings accounts, the rates will change over time, and when it comes time
to research potential returns on accounts in the future, I want a faster way to determine the exact benefits of different types of savings accounts. Hence
this project being born.
