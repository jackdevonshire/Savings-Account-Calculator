# Savings-Account-Calculator
A basic C# application for calculating the potential returns of various savings accounts.

## Why Make This?
After starting my graduate job, I realised I needed a plan for effectively saving my money. A lot of research and google sheets formulas later,
I figured out the perfect allocation of my funds on a monthly basis, to maximise my payoff over various accounts. As with all savings accounts, the rates will change over time, and when it comes time
to research potential returns on accounts in the future, I want a faster way to determine the exact benefits of different types of savings accounts. Hence
this project being born.
